## **About Me**

I am a novice web developer.

The main goal is to start a career as a developer.

Working for a long time in one area, you reach the ceiling and changes are necessary for sustainable development. IT for me is self-development, motivation and endless space for fantasy.

I am responsible for the task and complete them efficiently and in the shortest possible time. Sociable, quickly find a common language with the team.

I am stress-resistant and hardworking, if necessary, I can devote more time to work than was allotted at the beginning.
